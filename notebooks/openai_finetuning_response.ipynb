whines\\n\\nIt sings through the trees that you have to leave\\n\\nYour past on that empty field\\n\\nA nowhere run that’s born to yield\\n\\nAnd the sun keeps beating down\\n\\nOn you slight and sound\\n\\nBut you’re slowly losing tune\\n\\nThere’s no use expecting\\n\\nLet alone protecting\\n\\nThat mark of shadows at noon\\n\\n\\n\\nThe stories tell there’s a heaven in hell\\n\\nAnd the once-stitched up eye looks well\\n\\nGod’s century falls like a shadow swag\\n\\nIt follows the ancient red route rag\\n\\n\\n\\nBeneath the surface in the infernal gloom\\n\\nSlowly sinks the light of noon\\n\\nAffixed smoked shadows already appear\\n\\nToyota drivers in pale profile stand clear\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the haul of the flow where the caddis dream hinges\\n\\nthe mission days hide the window light’s syringe\\n\\nWhen the circle rewinds and the uneasiness flams\\n\\nFrom a calm little lake at the once-flooded dam\\n\\n\\n\\nThe bridge has buckled to rest on the setting sun\\n\\nYet the naked jet and the factory debris\\n\\nAre straight out from Jonathan’s row and his gun\\n\\nBack to the red road where their shadows will flee\\n\\n\\n\\nThis world is corrupt up and down the bloodline\\n\\nThough its use lies destroyed in the shifting of time\\n\\nDrop and fly all the works off the dime\\n\\nAnd the old gypsy woman, she gave me a sign\\n\\nAnd the song I would sing is a friend fast and from far\\n\\nAnd the last shall now be first\\n\\nFor my dreams avoid and abhor as a scar\\n\\nAnd the dust that once remains has already dispersed\\n\\n\\n\\nMy eyes blink north and the rest crash aside\\n\\nAmong the peaks where their shadows still hide\\n\\nAnd the sunlight’s scorch is like a phantom curse\\n\\nThese are the open wounds of time’s last verse\\n\\n\\n\\nThat stands alone for nothing is worth the cost\\n\\nOf the rest of the gifts whose total yard is lost\\n\\nTheir hollow parting looks, their hand to hand remarks\\n\\nThat beats like silent drums in the shadows of the park\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd borne to earth in restless flow\\n\\nSlow shadows answered the burning glow\\n\\nAnd they say time will improve the beat\\n\\nOf the ancient and wounded feet\\n\\n\\n\\nBut not a laughter can ever still\\n\\nThe steel drive that moves the human will\\n\\nOr shape the sound of childhood sweet\\n\\nOr pick back-up the burning street\\n\\n\\n\\nThe pain has spread from coast to coast\\n\\nThe nation’s buried beneath the dose\\n\\nOf a vengeful ghost that shines a key\\n\\nTo the black we may never unlock see\\n\\nAnd our position is most aloof\\n\\nAs our love once laughed in the golden roof\\n\\nWith the ghost deadline in the lost ideal\\n\\nAnd the sacred to be born is the law’s last thrill\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd special kindly jokehood will send her\\n\\nHoping say, “I beg you remember me!”\\n\\nOn the pier there’s no light bent down\\n\\nOn the pair shadowed gardens where love was sworn\\n\\n\\n\\nThen an image looms in a dirty shade\\n\\nThe result is impossible to ignore:\\n\\nThe forest ends, they come together\\n\\nThe shade is cast, light and warm\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd beyond the grass divide over there\\n\\nStand the pale empty drums unconquered\\n\\nThat sounds and pounds the face festoon\\n\\nWith crimson rain and untamed ruin\\n\\n\\n\\nBehold the endless oceans bound\\n\\nAnd the refugees drifting from town to town\\n\\nWe march on into slave-oiled wings\\n\\nFor the smokestack burns and the harp unstrings\\n\\n\\n\\nThe needle skims a sickened hand\\n\\nIf the wind will tries he tries for the brand\\n\\nAnd Jubal’s homeless nation bellows at you\\n\\nIt’ll be like this every day from now on the shadows at noon\\n\\n\\n\\nThe meth lab queen has islanded the drifters\\n\\nAnd the energy factor jumps to the Satanic rate\\n\\nIt moves from Under 8 to Heaven’s gate\\n\\nAnd everywhere in the dangers that remain\\n\\nIt’s a gypsy scam and the roll of the dice\\n\\nAnd it’s all right here in the early morn and middle of the night\\n\\nAnd as the defenders of the drinking well\\n\\nShuffle off into this hostage scene\\n\\nThey end up in the total embrace\\n\\nBenefiting from Heavens’ glow and\\n\\nHurt on ice in the market’s greed\\n\\nWhere dreams rise, fall and ride on its face\\n\\nBut the puppet dance sees the chains that I came in with\\n\\nWire tapped and torn as bolted hands\\n\\nTimes’ corrupt spires with all its wires onPressed\\n\\nHere stands the prince confused\\n\\nBy whose side is the wise man anyhow\\n\\nThat’s probably the only thing I cannot be sure\\n\\nWhen the muzzle and the bubble is the horse’s attack\\n\\nIt shows you what’s funny about that\\n\\n\\n\\nWho gave that man the keys to the bridge\\n\\nThe man from the windmills with the badge and the sirens’ cry\\n\\nSays, “Could you keep a watch and could I stay with you\\n\\nJust around the corner, about a mile from home?\\n\\n\\n\\nI picked a few lines, out of a hymn\\n\\nTaking disco notes of shivery, splendid dim\\n\\nWhile the dying dark waits for nothing but the breadth\\n\\nWhich most refuse to rub or play\\nAnd The Lone Ranger hit the stage\\n\\nAnd he hit the enigma, with splendor and blights\\n\\nTwirling twite with disarray in the night\\n\\nWhile the black monster, the sun and the solar sites\\n\\nEntomb the spoils taken from a protest room\\n\\nLeaking whispers from the shadows at noon\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd the masters make what they will of the laws\\n\\nShards of bone riddles of Misfortunes Dragon tales\\n\\nThe endless naturist myths of Mr. Green and

riddle shines just\\n\\nFloating on the tar and the road of the cross\\n\\nFor at the cusp the darkness is rejoicing\\n\\nOver the rainbow where the Deutschland spawn is burnt\\n\\nFrom the cops and Christians from the whale’s prayer pit\\n\\nAnd the Vermillion rain splashes the longing streets\\n\\nAnd fills the tattered net where the crusaders seek their post\\n\\nBehold the heart of a destroying sun that dawns revelation!\\n\\n\\n\\nThe forgotten peaks of old Siberia weep the chino’d father\\n\\nTo the gravesite mourners farewell teardrops in vodka!\\n\\nSlowly the tapestry is

dove\\n\\n\\n\\nThe gentle hebephrenic Ryan [sic] plays a harp\\n\\nWhile the elliptic and the incognito bond with macabre monkey breath\\n\\nChan the divine instrument and angelic fool\\n\\nWhose
